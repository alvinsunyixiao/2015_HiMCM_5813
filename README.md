Within the 36-hour competition, our team achieved computer simulations with cellular automata algorithms, simulating real-world situations for road mergence problems. I was charged for most of the coding and some mathematical reasoning. We used our model to find relationships between drivers' behaviors and system efficiency and fairness. We came up with suggestions to help the government better manage road mergence situations.

This title, National Finalist, was ranked 2% among over 700 high school teams across the globe.
